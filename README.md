<h1>Fitness Database</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a database that was designed in Oracle that stores and manages information about users, trainers, fitness goals and exercises with a goal of helping users track workouts and goals. I created this project because I love to excerise and go to the gym regularly. I focused on creating a structure that made it easy to undestand user progress and excerise data. I learned how to improve queries and to make retrieving information faster and more efficient to support better insights into user habits and goal achievement.
<h2>Files</h2>
<ul>
<li>Database: Files that will create all the tables</li>
<li>View: Inserts sample data into the table and views them</li>
<li>Wipe: Wipes all data and tabales created</li>
<li>SampleData: PDF file containing all the sample data</li>
<li>ERDiagram: PDF Entity relationship model diagram</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to run</h2>
1) Go to Oracle, and first run <code>wipe.sql</code> to override any existing databases with the same name<br>
2) Run <code>database.sql</code> to create all the tables<br>
3) Run <code>view.sql</code> to insert sample data into the tables and view them
